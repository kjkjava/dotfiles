dotfiles
========

Don't leave home without 'em.

### Description
These are some of my system configuration files. They include some things I've
picked up here and there and they work for me.

This repository is mainly for my personal use (to clone whenever I get a new
account) but hopefully others will find it useful as well.

### Usage
Read through the provided install script, change the variables as necessary,
then run it.

Alternatively, you may manually create symlinks to these files in your home
directory. You may also copy them, but using symlinks will keep the actual data
under version control.

The dot prefix has been removed from the files here as not to hide them. Of
course, the dotfiles in your actual home directory need dots in front.
